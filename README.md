## Choicely - The desicion-making-helper

Everybody knows the start of the "food-situation":

👨🏻‍🦰: "what do we eat today?"
👨🏽‍🦱: "I don't know!"

This can evolve to a loop of undecidedness and both parties are frustated at the end 😎 Wouldn't it be good to have a tool that helps you decide?
Well, this is where **choicely** comes in!
Stripped-down to the essentials it should help the user to make a decision much quicker by giving two options.

1. Lazy mode ➡ offers you 3 different Restaurant...you just have to choose the one you like the most or you can refresh the list
2. Filter mode ➡ let you specify up to 3 options like "food style" or f.e. "cuisine style"

In the future there will be more features planned like "entertainment" or "vacation"
